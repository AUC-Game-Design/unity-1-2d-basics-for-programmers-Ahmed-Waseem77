# AUC Game Design : 2D Basics For Programmers

## 🚀 Welcome to Your First Unity 2D Game Development Journey!

This tutorial is an **essential step** in your learning journey. Unity’s official [2D Beginner Adventure Game](https://learn.unity.com/course/2d-beginner-adventure-game?uv=2022.3) tutorial covers the fundamental aspects of 2D game development. If you do not **complete the entire tutorial**, you will face significant difficulties when designing and implementing your own game in the coming weeks.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Installed the **latest Unity LTS version** (as per the setup instructions given earlier this week).
- Familiarized yourself with **Git basics** and GitHub workflows.

## 📂 Opening the Repository in Unity

Once you've cloned the project, **open the project in Unity**:

- Launch Unity Hub.
- Click **Open** and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
- Select the project and open it.

### 🎮 Jump Straight into Development

We have already imported **the starter assets** from Unity’s tutorial and created the project for you. This means you can get right into it once you've cloned this project and opened it in Unity, and **start directly** at "Player Character and Movement".

## 📜 Requirements and Grading

- The due date will be communicated in class.
- To complete this assignment, you must **work through all parts** of the tutorial, from **"Player Character and Movement"** to **"Enhance and Polish"**.
- Successfully finishing these sections will guarantee you a **B+ grade**.
- To earn an **A- or A**, you must go beyond the tutorial and **implement an original enhancement** to the game you developed throughout the tutorial. This could include:
  - **A new mechanic**
  - **A significant improvement of an existing mechanic**
  - **Improved visuals**
  - **Other creative modifications**
- You must commit all files **push your work to the repository** to count as a submission. If you do not push your work, it **will not be considered**, and you will receive an **F**.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Disk Space**: Ensure you have at least **4GB of free space** before opening the project. Unity generates temporary files and downloads necessary packages during the project's lifecycle.
- **Preferred IDE**: 
  - If you're on **Windows**, use **Visual Studio 2022** (installed with Unity). It is already configured for Unity projects.
  - If you're on **Mac**, you will have to use **Visual Studio Code**, as Visual Studio 2022 is not available on macOS.
- **API Differences**: The tutorial was created for **Unity 2022**, but we are using **Unity 6000**. Expect minor API changes, such as:
  - `rigidbody.velocity` → **`rigidbody.linearVelocity`**

## 🏆 Get Started Now!

Mastering these basics will **empower you** to create your own unique 2D games in the weeks ahead. Happy coding! 🎮🔥
